# Lightpack + Prismatik HTTP API

A small http server for controlling a [Lightpack][] via Prismatik's API.


I'm using it in conjunction with [homebridge-http](https://github.com/rudders/homebridge-http) so that I can control my [Lightpack][] via HomeKit and Siri.


## Usage

Get the current status (as json):

```sh
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/lightpack"
```

Turn it on:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:8080/lightpack/on"
```

Turn it off:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:8080/lightpack/off"
```

Change to profile `PROFILE_NAME`:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:8080/lightpack/profile/PROFILE_NAME"
```

## Responses

Successful requests get a 200 with a body of JSON:

```javascript
{
  'power': 'on',
  'profile': 'Lightpack'
}
```

Bad requests get a 404 with no body.

1. This is the first Python I've ever written and I make no claims to it's quality or style.
2. I wrote this for myself so it's portability between systems is questionable at best ðŸ˜„
